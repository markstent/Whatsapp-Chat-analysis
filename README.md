# Analysing the Whatsapp group chat with my 3 daughters

My girls live pretty far away from me, so Whatsapp is an important part of how we communicate. So I decided to analyse our chats over the last 2 years and see what I find!

## Technologies/Libraries used

- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- NLTK
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Wordcloud
- Emoji
## The Results

I was able to extract data for 2 years from my Whatsapp chat, put it into a Pandas dataframe and answer the following questions:

- Who sent the most messages?
- What is the busiest day for chatting
- Who sends the most images?
- Who records the most voice notes?
- What are the most popular words used in our family chat?
- What is the most popular chat time?
- What Emoji's are used most in the chat?
- What does our message frequency look like over time?
- What was the overall tone of our conversation?
- Who types the most in the family?
## Lessons Learned

This project allowed me to practice EDA visualisation while having fun using Python and making something to laugh with my girls about.

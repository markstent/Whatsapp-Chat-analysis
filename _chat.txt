[2022/01/03, 10:56:58] Chicane: i just looked at the stationary list for IT
[2022/01/03, 10:57:08] Chicane: there‚Äôs so much extra money that needs to be spent
[2022/01/03, 10:57:19] Chicane: we need a whole new ipad and own wifi source
[2022/01/03, 10:57:21] Mark Stent: that‚Äôs why you need to decide now

[2022/01/03, 10:57:43] Chicane: moms already paid though, so i‚Äôm not sure if we can change now
[2022/01/03, 10:57:55] Chicane: i‚Äôm saying, for at school we have to have our own wifi access
[2022/01/03, 10:57:58] Chicane: because they don‚Äôt have wifi
[2022/01/03, 10:58:03] Chicane: IT

[2022/01/03, 10:59:08] Chicane: as well as a laptop or tablet
[2022/01/03, 10:59:12] Mark Stent: how is that even possible ?
[2022/01/03, 10:59:21] Chicane: and the laptop has to be microsoft
[2022/01/03, 10:59:33] Mark Stent: that‚Äôs ridiculous
[2022/01/03, 10:59:49] Mark Stent: This school is ending up way more expensive that mom said

[2022/03/18, 10:36:17] Chicane: because we can‚Äôt do that alone
[2022/03/18, 10:36:24] Mark Stent: i didnt ask you to
[2022/03/18, 10:36:26] Chicane: you said it yourself, it‚Äôs difficult to get one at 16

[2022/03/18, 10:37:19] Chicane: yes that‚Äôs fine, i‚Äôll get a job if that‚Äôs what you want dad
[2022/03/18, 10:38:14] Mark Stent: i worked from age 13
[2022/03/18, 10:38:28] Mark Stent: my mom didnt give me a cent
[2022/03/18, 10:38:31] Mark Stent: she didnt have it
[2022/03/18, 10:38:35] Mark Stent: and i DEF didnt expect it
[2022/03/18, 10:38:45] Mark Stent: i dont even mind the money
[2022/03/18, 10:38:51] Mark Stent: its how you EXPECT it, like you are owed it
[2022/03/18, 10:38:59] Mark Stent: that shows that you are very very spoilt
[2022/03/18, 10:39:02] Chicane: we don‚Äôt expect anything dad
[2022/03/18, 10:39:06] Chicane: that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre asking
[2022/03/18, 10:39:17] Chicane: if we expected it, we wouldn‚Äôt be asking
[2022/03/18, 10:39:20] Mark Stent: you just told me its my job to do that
[2022/03/18, 10:39:24] Chicane: and we‚Äôre saying that we won‚Äôt ask next month
[2022/03/18, 10:39:27] Mark Stent: i always help you were i can
[2022/03/18, 10:39:28] Mark Stent: always
[2022/03/18, 10:39:31] Chicane: to provide for your kids dadüòê
[2022/03/18, 10:39:36] Chicane: not saying for our entertainment
[2022/03/18, 10:39:38] Mark Stent: but i would like to see some effort
[2022/03/18, 10:39:47] Mark Stent: so why would you bring that up..do i not provide?
[2022/03/18, 10:40:24] Mark Stent: your attitude is this
[2022/03/18, 10:40:26] Mark Stent: you ask
[2022/03/18, 10:40:26] Chicane: never mind dad
[2022/03/18, 10:40:34] Chicane: don‚Äôt want to fight with you
[2022/03/18, 10:40:36] Mark Stent: then if i question it then you throw little comments like that
[2022/03/18, 10:40:43] Mark Stent: which is manipulative
[2022/03/18, 10:40:50] Mark Stent: and disrespectful
[2022/03/18, 10:40:58] Mark Stent: i always go out of my way to help you when i can
[2022/03/18, 10:41:02] Mark Stent: always
[2022/03/18, 10:41:20] Chicane: we know that, and we really do appreciate it dad
[2022/03/18, 10:41:28] Chicane: but i think you‚Äôre taking what i said in the wrong way
[2022/03/18, 10:41:30] Mark Stent: i was very happy to give you the money
[2022/03/18, 10:41:41] Mark Stent: but im actually shocked at how spoilt you are
[2022/03/18, 10:43:13] Mark Stent: i will give you the money now

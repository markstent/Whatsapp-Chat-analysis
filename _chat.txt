[2021/12/26, 11:03:06] Mark Stent: Sis man it only takes a minute if your time to think about the people you love

[2021/12/26, 11:03:44] Kiara: This goes both ways
[2021/12/26, 11:04:31] Mark Stent: it’s not about what they do
[2021/12/26, 11:04:43] Mark Stent: always be the better person

[2021/12/26, 11:06:57] Mark Stent: at all
[2021/12/26, 11:07:33] Mark Stent: Gran made a huge effort for your bday.. not sure why she didn’t message in the day… her memory is terrible at the moment … she forgot we were going for dinner for Christmas at her
[2021/12/26, 11:07:50] Mark Stent: It’s not about who messages who… it’s Christmas
[2021/12/26, 11:08:06] Kiara: Dad I didn’t say I wasn’t going to message gran, it was a busy day yesterday as I’m sure it was for her too

[2022/01/03, 08:19:39] Mark Stent: Secret is to be consistent
[2022/01/03, 08:19:44] Mark Stent: And not take lots of time off
[2022/01/03, 08:19:59] Mark Stent: Else you fall into the trap everyone else does… always getting back into it

[2022/01/03, 08:40:53] Chicane: do you know what the name of the app dad used was?
[2022/01/03, 08:41:12] Chicane: i’ve downloaded calm but you can basically do nothing unless you pay for the full version
[2022/01/03, 08:41:41] Kiara: It was calm. Calm is amazing if you pay
[2022/01/03, 08:41:53] Kiara: Try some YouTube ones as well

[2022/01/03, 09:06:04] Mark Stent: There are some free meditations there
[2022/01/03, 09:06:13] Mark Stent: Calm is ridiculous now and has gotten too commercial
[2022/01/03, 09:06:25] Mark Stent: This is so cool
[2022/01/03, 09:59:26] Chicane: okay cool, thanks dad
[2022/01/03, 10:51:19] Chicane: dad, do you think if we ask impaq to change one subject, it’ll cost extra?
[2022/01/03, 10:56:28] Mark Stent: I do t know
[2022/01/03, 10:56:32] Mark Stent: I doubt it
[2022/01/03, 10:56:39] Mark Stent: But you need to mail them asap
[2022/01/03, 10:56:42] Mark Stent: Don’t wait
[2022/01/03, 10:56:58] Chicane: i just looked at the stationary list for IT
[2022/01/03, 10:57:08] Chicane: there’s so much extra money that needs to be spent
[2022/01/03, 10:57:19] Chicane: we need a whole new ipad and own wifi source
[2022/01/03, 10:57:21] Mark Stent: that’s why you need to decide now
[2022/01/03, 10:57:24] Mark Stent: So it’s not wasted
[2022/01/03, 10:57:31] Mark Stent: iPad for what ?
[2022/01/03, 10:57:40] Mark Stent: You have Wi-Fi so that’s fine
[2022/01/03, 10:57:43] Chicane: moms already paid though, so i’m not sure if we can change now
[2022/01/03, 10:57:55] Chicane: i’m saying, for at school we have to have our own wifi access
[2022/01/03, 10:57:58] Chicane: because they don’t have wifi
[2022/01/03, 10:58:03] Chicane: IT
[2022/01/03, 10:58:06] Mark Stent: Well you need to get mom to email today
[2022/01/03, 10:58:09] Mark Stent: Don’t wait
[2022/01/03, 10:58:29] Mark Stent: That’s for at home … at school you won’t need Wi-Fi
[2022/01/03, 10:59:00] Chicane: on the stationary list, it says that we need our own wifi access for school if you take CAT or IT
[2022/01/03, 10:59:08] Chicane: as well as a laptop or tablet
[2022/01/03, 10:59:12] Mark Stent: how is that even possible ?
[2022/01/03, 10:59:21] Chicane: and the laptop has to be microsoft
[2022/01/03, 10:59:33] Mark Stent: that’s ridiculous
[2022/01/03, 10:59:49] Mark Stent: This school is ending up way more expensive that mom said
[2022/01/03, 10:59:50] Chicane: and we have to pay extra for google access too
[2022/01/03, 11:00:02] Mark Stent: Please send me the list
[2022/01/03, 11:00:08] Mark Stent: What Google access ?

[2022/03/17, 16:45:28] Skyla-Jean: it went okay
[2022/03/17, 16:45:32] Skyla-Jean: was definitely a big shock
[2022/03/17, 16:45:36] Skyla-Jean: despite studying hard
[2022/03/17, 16:46:16] Mark Stent: hard?
[2022/03/17, 17:01:48] Skyla-Jean: it was hard

[2022/03/17, 17:05:01] Skyla-Jean: tyat the first test is always the hardest
[2022/03/17, 17:05:06] Skyla-Jean: because we don’t know what to expect
[2022/03/17, 18:01:37] Mark Stent: just keep doing your best
[2022/03/17, 18:01:41] Mark Stent: That’s all that counts
[2022/03/17, 18:25:32] Skyla-Jean: i know that next term i need to work harder
[2022/03/17, 18:25:35] Skyla-Jean: i did work hard
[2022/03/17, 18:25:43] Skyla-Jean: but i need to study earlier in advance
[2022/03/18, 06:10:28] Mark Stent: I’d love to help you anytime
[2022/03/18, 10:27:24] Skyla-Jean: hi dad, Chicane and i wanna go to movies later because we haven’t been in a while. would u mind putting R200 on my card?
[2022/03/18, 10:30:57] Mark Stent: then you dont get at end of month again
[2022/03/18, 10:31:33] Skyla-Jean: that’s fine
[2022/03/18, 10:31:45] Mark Stent: you cant keep doing this
[2022/03/18, 10:31:51] Mark Stent: its not how it works and you are not learning anything from this
[2022/03/18, 10:32:02] Chicane: and for me as well please dad, i also won’t get next month
[2022/03/18, 10:32:21] Chicane: dad we understand that, but we can’t be expected to save and only spend R200 a month
[2022/03/18, 10:32:38] Chicane: things aren’t cheap nowadays
[2022/03/18, 10:33:10] Mark Stent: well thats what you have and you need to make it work
[2022/03/18, 10:33:14] Mark Stent: money is not endless
[2022/03/18, 10:33:15] Chicane: we don’t plan our plans for the entire month, so we don’t know what we should be spending it on
[2022/03/18, 10:33:23] Mark Stent: i have a limited amount too
[2022/03/18, 10:33:35] Mark Stent: well in life you have to plan
[2022/03/18, 10:33:40] Mark Stent: and if you dont have money, you dont make plans
[2022/03/18, 10:33:43] Mark Stent: end of story
[2022/03/18, 10:33:53] Mark Stent: thats what me, your mom and the rest of the world have to do
[2022/03/18, 10:34:02] Chicane: we understand that dad, but we don’t ask for a lot
you pay so much more towards kiara and she’s actually earning money
[2022/03/18, 10:34:06] Chicane: we don’t earn anything
[2022/03/18, 10:34:16] Mark Stent: i pay a lot to you too actually
[2022/03/18, 10:34:24] Mark Stent: i pay your medical aid, school fees and more
[2022/03/18, 10:35:18] Chicane: i don’t want to fight with you dad, but that’s what parents are supposed to do
[2022/03/18, 10:35:27] Mark Stent: im not fighting
[2022/03/18, 10:35:29] Mark Stent: um no
[2022/03/18, 10:35:35] Mark Stent: that is NOT what parents are supposed to be
[2022/03/18, 10:35:45] Mark Stent: our job is to feed you and help you gro
[2022/03/18, 10:35:51] Mark Stent: not to support your entertainment
[2022/03/18, 10:35:54] Mark Stent: the cheek!
[2022/03/18, 10:35:56] Mark Stent: get a job
[2022/03/18, 10:35:58] Mark Stent: you are 16
[2022/03/18, 10:36:01] Mark Stent: thats what i did
[2022/03/18, 10:36:01] Chicane: i’m not saying that dad
[2022/03/18, 10:36:13] Chicane: i’m saying that parents are supposed to support their medical aid and school fees
[2022/03/18, 10:36:17] Chicane: because we can’t do that alone
[2022/03/18, 10:36:24] Mark Stent: i didnt ask you to
[2022/03/18, 10:36:26] Chicane: you said it yourself, it’s difficult to get one at 16
[2022/03/18, 10:36:28] Chicane: but sure
[2022/03/18, 10:36:29] Chicane: i will
[2022/03/18, 10:36:32] Mark Stent: have you tried?
[2022/03/18, 10:36:34] Mark Stent: at all?
[2022/03/18, 10:36:37] Mark Stent: even once?
[2022/03/18, 10:36:46] Mark Stent: i know other kids your age who do have
[2022/03/18, 10:37:02] Chicane: no i haven’t dad, because it’s not something i have to do
[2022/03/18, 10:37:06] Chicane: i’m still a minor
[2022/03/18, 10:37:19] Chicane: yes that’s fine, i’ll get a job if that’s what you want dad
[2022/03/18, 10:38:14] Mark Stent: i worked from age 13
[2022/03/18, 10:38:28] Mark Stent: my mom didnt give me a cent
[2022/03/18, 10:38:31] Mark Stent: she didnt have it
[2022/03/18, 10:38:35] Mark Stent: and i DEF didnt expect it
[2022/03/18, 10:38:45] Mark Stent: i dont even mind the money
[2022/03/18, 10:38:51] Mark Stent: its how you EXPECT it, like you are owed it
[2022/03/18, 10:38:59] Mark Stent: that shows that you are very very spoilt
[2022/03/18, 10:39:02] Chicane: we don’t expect anything dad
[2022/03/18, 10:39:06] Chicane: that’s why we’re asking
[2022/03/18, 10:39:17] Chicane: if we expected it, we wouldn’t be asking
[2022/03/18, 10:39:20] Mark Stent: you just told me its my job to do that
[2022/03/18, 10:39:24] Chicane: and we’re saying that we won’t ask next month
[2022/03/18, 10:39:27] Mark Stent: i always help you were i can
[2022/03/18, 10:39:28] Mark Stent: always
[2022/03/18, 10:39:31] Chicane: to provide for your kids dad😐
[2022/03/18, 10:39:36] Chicane: not saying for our entertainment
[2022/03/18, 10:39:38] Mark Stent: but i would like to see some effort
[2022/03/18, 10:39:47] Mark Stent: so why would you bring that up..do i not provide?
[2022/03/18, 10:40:24] Mark Stent: your attitude is this
[2022/03/18, 10:40:26] Mark Stent: you ask
[2022/03/18, 10:40:26] Chicane: never mind dad
[2022/03/18, 10:40:34] Chicane: don’t want to fight with you
[2022/03/18, 10:40:36] Mark Stent: then if i question it then you throw little comments like that
[2022/03/18, 10:40:43] Mark Stent: which is manipulative
[2022/03/18, 10:40:50] Mark Stent: and disrespectful
[2022/03/18, 10:40:58] Mark Stent: i always go out of my way to help you when i can
[2022/03/18, 10:41:02] Mark Stent: always
[2022/03/18, 10:41:20] Chicane: we know that, and we really do appreciate it dad
[2022/03/18, 10:41:28] Chicane: but i think you’re taking what i said in the wrong way
[2022/03/18, 10:41:30] Mark Stent: i was very happy to give you the money
[2022/03/18, 10:41:41] Mark Stent: but im actually shocked at how spoilt you are
[2022/03/18, 10:43:13] Mark Stent: i will give you the money now
[2022/03/18, 10:43:26] Mark Stent: but i want to see what you are tryhing to do to earn some of your own
[2022/03/18, 10:43:43] Mark Stent: at least the effort
[2022/03/18, 10:43:46] Mark Stent: as i told you before
[2022/03/18, 10:43:57] Mark Stent: if you want to be like everyone...just sit back and do what everyone else does
[2022/03/18, 10:44:21] Chicane: i didn’t mean that it’s your job ro pay for our entertainment or everything that we choose to do
i meant that a parents job is to provide the basic necessities to their child, which you do
and when you said that you pay for our medical aid and school fees, i took if as if you were complaining 
so maybe i took it in the wrong way, im sorry dad
[2022/03/18, 10:44:37] Mark Stent: no i never complain
[2022/03/18, 10:45:02] Mark Stent: i dont think you have any idea how much i pay to look after all of you...and i never expect you to because i love looking after you
[2022/03/18, 10:53:42] Mark Stent: i love you both and want you to grow
[2022/03/18, 10:53:42] Skyla-Jean: thank you dad, we really appreciate it❤️❤️
[2022/03/18, 10:53:43] Mark Stent: thats all
[2022/03/18, 10:53:48] Skyla-Jean: we love you too
[2022/03/18, 10:53:51] Mark Stent: my job is to prepare you for the world
[2022/03/18, 13:27:48] Skyla-Jean: dad
[2022/03/18, 13:27:48] Skyla-Jean: have you not put money on my card ?
[2022/03/18, 13:27:49] Skyla-Jean: i just went to check at atm
